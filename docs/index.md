# VoidRun: An Isolated Environment for Code Execution

## About the Project

VoidRun is an isolated environment for code execution. It provides a safe and secure environment for executing code in a controlled environment, preventing potential vulnerabilities or attacks. It uses Firejail, a sandboxing tool, to isolate the code execution environment, ensuring that the code is executed in a controlled and secure environment.

## Usecases

Examples of usecases for VoidRun include:


- Testing code in a controlled environment.
- Debugging code in a controlled environment.
- Executing code in a controlled environment.
- Judging code in a controlled environment.
- Running projects that require installing dependencies or network access.

## New Features

- **Multi-file execution**: upload several files at once.
- **Dependency installation**: provide setup commands like `pip install`.
- **Optional networking**: enable network access when needed for tests.
